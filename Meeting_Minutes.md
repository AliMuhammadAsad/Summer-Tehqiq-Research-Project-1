3. Review of the tentative weekly course schedule
4. Went over the grading policy of the course; problem setting decided to be 1 problem submission per student

## $27^{\text{th}}$ June 2023
**Venue:** Dr.Waqar Saleem's Faculty Pod, Room: C-122

**Attendees:** Dr.Waqar Saleem, Ali Muhammad Asad, Areesha Amir, Iqra Ahmed

**Written By:** Iqra Ahmed

**Meeting Agenda:** 
1. Discuss the remaining work done on the literature review.
2. Discuss the collection, and week wise schedule and table for courses using Halim’s book
3. Discuss our own week-wise tentative schedule
4. Discuss the next steps and tasks until the next meeting

**Discussion Key Points:**
1. Went over the findings from the literature review
2. Went over the data collected from existing courses on their topic distribution
3. Discussion on the appropriate platform(s) to use for our course.
    a. Codeforces vs. Kattis
      - Kattis only allows the use of problems from the database which could  be a problem when designing exams
      - Creating new problems would be a tedious process requiring not only to design problems but also appropriate test cases to thoroughly test the program so we may opt out of creating new problems entirely.

    b. Use of an Online Judge such as DOM or UVa to prevent plagiarism.

    c. The need for a private domain and the pricing problems associated with it.

**Feedback from the Professor:**
1. Continue searching for papers that list strategies to measure the effectiveness of a course
2. Need to continue building the table and add book names/editions for each course

**Current Tasks Assigned:**
1. Look into papers on measuring the effectiveness of a course (due to the lack of competitive programming-specific courses, papers not directly referring to CP courses should also be referred to)
2. Continue building the table listing the week-wise schedule and topic distribution in already existing competitive programming courses and move towards consolidating the data to determine an appropriate week-wise topic distribution for our course.
3. Look into the pricing strategy of platforms (i.e. per student charges/institution charges etc)
